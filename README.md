# Entrance

Entrance is an app that allows paid timed voice calls between creators and their fans. It aims to create enriched creator-fan interactions and provide a new source of revenue for creators.
This is the front-end for a prototype that was discontinued because of its dependence on a streaming platform. A newer version that is streaming platform agnostic is currently in the works.
This version also suffers from a lack of a back-end. As a result, much of the information is stored on localStorage which can lead to breaches of sensitive information. As a result,
this version of the front-end application is being discontinued and can serve as a testament of my front-end capabilities as a developer. Note that all the code was written by me.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
